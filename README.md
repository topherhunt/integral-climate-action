# App: Integral Climate Hub

## Code principles

- Simpler is better. Resist overcomplexifying. Prefer duplication over imperfect abstraction.
- HTML classes for CSS, JS, and test selection should be namespaced and kept strictly separate. For example, any class used for selecting elements in tests should start with `test-`.

## Todo

- App renders times in terms of US EST; make this sensitive to where the user is
