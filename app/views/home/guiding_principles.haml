  %h1 Principles of Thriveability Lab

  %h3 Humans thrive in connection with nature
  %ul
    %li The purpose of this platform is to advance our individual and collective ability to "thrive" in sync with Nature, her systems, and all of life.
    %li Our task is to learn to collaborate ~ with ourselves, with each other, and with nature.
    %li Science shows that nature tends to make us more happy, healthy, and social, underscoring not only the individual but also the collective benefits of nature in our lives and world.
    %li Our natural world is infinitely precious and important, and an awe-some source of potential, wisdom, and inspiration.

  %h3 Impactful change requires new ways of thinking
  %ul
    %li Fostering creative change is as much, or more, about achieving positive impacts as it is about reducing negative impacts.
    %li Shifting the focus from ‘fixing problems’ to thriving, regeneration, and well-being creates an inspiring sustainability narrative, maybe even a new story for our time.
    %li Real change requires changes ‘from the inside-out’ ~ changes amounting to nothing less than a ‘paradigm shift’.
    %li Rather than focusing on specific sectors or disciplines, we need integrated solutions that address systems, behaviors, psychology, and culture.

  %h3 Making change is a collaborative, emergent, and personal process
  %ul
    %li Innovative solutions ‘emerge’ from radical experimentation and self-organization rather than from top-down planning and control.
    %li Positive, deep change is made together: Together our creative expression increases, new capacities emerge, and innovative collaborations open up.
    %li The quality of our own presence and attention is key to our power and potential as change-makers.
    %li Working on our growth and development as individuals is therefore an integral part of bettering our world.

  %h3 Supporting humans to thrive is key to addressing complex challenges
  %ul
    %li In essence, people are intelligent, creative, adaptive, self-organizing, and meaning-seeking. Fostering that human potential is therefore key to addressing our greatest challenges.
    %li Fundamentally, we are all part of one human family. The more we can stand together, the stronger we become. Protecting the most vulnerable among us means protecting all of us.
    %li The most effective recipe for a ‘thriving’ world is investing in people’s ability to thrive and empowering them to live a truly ‘good life’ ~ a life in connection with oneself, others, and nature.
    %li Our creative challenge is to connect a global, world-centric vision with local action and embodied transformation.
