        %h1 What is Thriveability Lab?
        %p Thriveability Lab is a peer-to-peer platform where anybody with interest in fostering a more ‘thriving’ world can come to be inspired and empowered.
        %p Thriveability Lab aims to support people to connect, to learn and grow together, and to bring more visibility, collaboration, and impact to their initiatives.
        %p The platform is designed to support high quality conversations, creative action, community, experiment, and the sharing of resources. As well as the emergence of more integrative, life-enhancing values, paradigms, and approaches to change. See #{link_to "our guiding principles", principles_path} to learn more.
        %p This platform is open source. You're welcome to check out the source code or make your own copy of the site at #{link_to "our GitHub repository", "https://github.com/topherhunt/thriveability-lab", target: "_blank"}.

        %h3 Why "thriveability"?
        %p Thriveability refers to ‘our ability to thrive’ ~ our individual and collective capacity to ‘flourish’ and ‘flower’ in synergy with ourselves, each other, and Nature.
        %p Thriveability is thus about more than the ability to ‘sustain’ ourselves (sustainability), and offers an inspiring ideal, a mobilizing vision for the future that can speak to all humans. After all, who doesn’t want to thrive?
        %p Fundamentally, the notion points to an appreciation of the human potential for goodness, truth, and beauty, and an exciting sense of what life is all about.

        %h3 Why a lab-approach to change?
        %p It is becoming clear that our complex, systemic, global challenges cannot be addressed with approaches based on traditional planning and top-down control.
        %p We therefore aim to support more daring and innovative approaches. Approaches based on experiment, learning, self-organization, and creative collaboration. That is, ‘laboratory-style’ approaches to change.
        %p That’s why we refer to our platform as a lab. A lab where we bundle our creative forces to advance our capacity for thriving. Hence: Thriveability Lab.

        %h3 A value-driven social platform
        %p Many social platforms suffer from a host of problems because they are shaped by the corporate values that dominate our economy and society. That is, they are profit-driven rather than value-driven.
        %p We don’t believe in this approach. Yet we do see the enormous potential of social platforms for making change for the better.
        %p That’s why we have created a value-driven social platform: a platform inspired by values and worldviews that are currently gaining traction on a global scale, and offer powerful alternatives for the narrow-minded focus on profit only.
        %p These values include mindfulness, nature, service to the greater whole, integration, compassion, purpose, inner growth, openness to learning, and collaboration. Thriveability Lab aims to both support and embody these values.

        %h3 Who are we?

        %p We are Annick and Topher, and we have been working on this platform for a number of years, motivated to create a social platform that is designed for supporting the deep, transformative change that we sense is so needed in our world.
